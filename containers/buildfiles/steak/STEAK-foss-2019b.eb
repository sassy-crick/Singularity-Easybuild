description = """Detects integrations of any sort in high-throughput 
sequencing (HTS) data. STEAK was built for validating and discovering 
transposable element (TE) and retroviral integrations in a variety of 
HTS data. The software performs on both single-end (SE) and paired-end (
PE) libraries and on a variety of HTS sequencing strategies. It can 
be applied to a broad range of research interests and clinical uses 
such as population genetic studies and detecting polymorphic integrations."""
